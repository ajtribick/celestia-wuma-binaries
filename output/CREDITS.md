# W Ursae Majoris binaries for Celestia

This archive contains W Ursae Majoris binaries for Celestia, based on the
[WUMaCat](https://wumacat.aob.rs) database. Each binary is represented as a
single star in Celestia, with a custom mesh giving it the shape of the common
envelope.

Spectral types, apparent magnitudes and cross-matching of identifiers to the
Hipparcos, Tycho and Gaia DR2 catalogues are obtained from SIMBAD. Where
V-magnitudes are not available, this is estimated using the relationships given
in Evans et al. (2018). Distances for stars not included in Celestia's
stars.dat file are taken from the Gaia DR2 geometric distance catalogue
(Bailer-Jones et al., 2018).
